# HealthInfo – AI Disease Predictor

## Description
HealthInfo is an AI-based disease prediction system capable of predicting four diseases: Breast Cancer, Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s. The project utilizes datasets from Kaggle and employs machine learning models trained with Logistic Regression and SVM, achieving an accuracy of over 85%. The trained models are saved as `.sav` files for deployment, and a Streamlit UI is integrated for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- Streamlit

## Features
- Predicts Breast Cancer, Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s
- Real-time predictions with Streamlit UI
- High accuracy models (85%+)
